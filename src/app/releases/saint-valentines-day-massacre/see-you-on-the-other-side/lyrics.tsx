    See you on the other side
    <br />
    It&apos;s been a harrowing year
    <br />
    Too much of a coward
    <br />
    To let my thoughts drift away
    <br />
    <br />
    Better off detaching myself
    <br />
    From the hard pills of sorrow
    <br />
    Spill my blood into half-empty cups
    <br />
    And wash it down with the tears of regret
    <br />
    <br />
    Bottle up my pain and pass it along
    <br />
    To my friends and family
    <br />
    On the day I discard myself
    <br />
    They will choose how they should remember me
    <br />
    <br />
    Grief will drag me down
    <br />
    <br />
    I don&apos;t believe in angels
    <br />
    But the devil surely has a place for me
    <br />
    <br />
    Haunted by ideations of tragedy
    <br />
    Grief will drag me down peacefully
    <br />
    I&apos;ll tell you everything
    <br />
    When I see you on the other side
    <br />
    I&apos;ll tell you everything
    <br />
    When I see you on the other side
    <br />
    <br />
    On the other side
    <br />
    On the other side
    <br />
    I&apos;ll tell you everything
    <br />
    When I see you on the other side
