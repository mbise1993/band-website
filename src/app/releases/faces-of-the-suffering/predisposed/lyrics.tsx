    Black dust sinks in
    <br />
    Between the floorboards, into my bloodstream
    <br />
    It's taken root in our homes and our lungs
    <br />
    Every second, on the tip of my tongue
    <br />
    Black dust
    <br />
    Inhale and burn your lungs
    <br />
    This cold air hangs like a disease
    <br />
    And leaves the taste of rot on your teeth
    <br />
    <br />
    Breathe it in, let it hit again
    <br />
    <br />
    Trading bibles for pamphlets, church pews for waiting rooms
    <br />
    Taking communion as a slow drip straight to my cut veins
    <br />
    If the gospel is small and round and blue then call me a disciple
    <br />
    Trade life for fading comfort, call it a revival
    <br />
    <br />
    A generation predisposed
    <br />
    To bloodshot eyes and broken homes
    <br />
    Breath it in, let it sink in
    <br />
    <br />
    Generations predisposed
    <br />
    To circling vultures with siren songs
    <br />
    Take a deep breath, it tastes so sweet
    <br />
    <br />
    Pill-blue faces
    <br />
    Filling the graves that you dug
    <br />
    Blood-stained profits
    <br />
    Inhale the black dust from our lungs
    <br />
    A label written in greed, masking a government-sanctioned eulogy
    <br />
    <br />
    [Spoken]
    <br />
    Watching my loved ones sink deeper into manufactured bliss
    <br />
    If this is utopia, then I&apos;d rather embrace the pain
    <br />
    <br />
    If this is utopia, then I&apos;d rather embrace the pain
