    So many years of being distant, of being dismissive
    <br />
    Countless Summers avoiding my own reflection
    <br />
    If all I have is this apathy and my isolation
    <br />
    Then what more could anyone want from me?
    <br />
    <br />
    Stitched together by the lies that fall from your venomous lips
    <br />
    Your voice is poisonous as plumes of cigarette smoke
    <br />
    You betrayed me even though I gave you everything I loved
    <br />
    These are the scars that time cannot erase
    <br />
    I have nothing left to give
    <br />
    <br />
    Broken and bruised
    <br />
    My body still bleeds for you
    <br />
    Rip out my eyes
    <br />
    So I don't have to see
    <br />
    The way your flesh recoils from me
    <br />
    <br />
    Sharp pains of growth were worth it in the end
    <br />
    I'd rather die than spend another day in this
    <br />
    Stagnant nightmare (stagnant nightmare)
    <br />
    Crawling through glowing coals
    <br />
    Just to watch you
    <br />
    <br />
    Burn
    <br />
    Broken and bruised
    <br />
    My body still bleeds for you
    <br />
    <br />
    [Spoken]
    <br />
    The most painful memories is of love no longer there
    <br />
    Past times have died along with who we used to be
    <br />
    Mourning the life we shared everyday
    <br />
    A test of my heart to withhold agony
    <br />
    <br />
    With my shattered hands
    <br />I crawl back to you
