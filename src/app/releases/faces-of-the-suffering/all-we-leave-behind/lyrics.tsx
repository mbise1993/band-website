    In melancholic fashion, catharsis is force-fed
    <br />
    Through veins and body, I&apos;m always laced in dread
    <br />
    Lifeless, I lay in a bed you couldn&apos;t mend
    <br />
    I linger beyond words that passed your lips and fading breath
    <br />
    So this is where I leave you
    <br />
    And this is where you&apos;ll stay
    <br />
    I hope to kill the part of you
    <br />
    That&apos;s still left in me
  </>
