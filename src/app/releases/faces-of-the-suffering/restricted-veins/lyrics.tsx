    I&apos;m calling it quits on what I know
    <br />
    A bloodbath in pale blue light
    <br />
    Crawl up the stairs, it hangs off the walls
    <br />
    Dripping with every single
    <br />
    <br />
    Ounce of shame
    <br />
    I have to give
    <br />
    It's starting to show
    <br />
    It's starting to fester as it eats away at the linings
    <br />
    Clinging to life but watching it slip into
    <br />
    <br />
    Two hollow eyes in a black screen
    <br />
    Filling them up, but it's not enough
    <br />
    It&apos;s never enough
    <br />
    <br />
    [Spoken]
    <br />
    A bloodbath in pale blue light
    <br />
    A bloodbath
    <br />
    <br />
    [Chorus]
    <br />
    How can I sleep at night
    <br />
    When I dream of all the ways I&apos;ll fail
    <br />
    I&apos;ve cursed my reflection, I&apos;ve written it off
    <br />
    Tell me lies, tell me I won&apos;t let you down
    <br />
    Promise me anything
    <br />
    Restrict my veins, use my blood to make you whole
    <br />
    <br />
    I&apos;ve seen your fears, and they are mine
    <br />
    Hopeless longing, unending grief
    <br />
    Lacking the courage to seal your fate with your own hands
    <br />
    <br />
    Don&apos;t pity the dead
    <br />
    The living still suffer
    <br />
    Don&apos;t pity the dead
    <br />
    <br />
    [Repeat chorus]
    <br />
    <br />
    A bloodbath in pale blue light
    <br />
    I&apos;m calling it quits
    <br />
    I&apos;m calling it
    <br />
    <br />
    Don&apos;t pity the dead
    <br />
    <br />
    A bloodbath in pale blue light
    <br />
    Restrict my veins, tell me lies
    <br />
    A bloodbath in pale blue light
    <br />
    Tell me lies
    <br />
    Tell me it will all be okay
