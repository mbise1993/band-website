    My desperate soul casts a lonely shadow of my guilt
    <br />
    Pleading whispers echo through what remains of our forsaken home
    <br />
    Bloodstained hands sharpening a rusty knife
    <br />
    Human transmutation, my life for your life
    <br />
    <br />
    Praying for answers, buried under the weight of all my grief
    <br />
    Begging to hear your comforting voice again
    <br />
    This house has burned to ash, the flames engulf me inside
    <br />
    I haven’t felt like myself since the day that you died
    <br />
    <br />
    Sacrificing my flesh into the abyss
    <br />
    Hope dies in vain, no time to reminisce
    <br />
    In the attic, circles drawn in salt and shame
    <br />
    I just need to see your face again
    <br />
    <br />
    [Spoken]
    <br />
    Promises made in desperate agony
    <br />
    To resurrect those that we’ve lost
    <br />
    Regardless of the ultimate cost
    <br />
    <br />
    Apparitions of my dead family
    <br />
    Haunt me when I close my eyes
    <br />
    Apparitions devoid of all facial features
    <br />
    Haunt me when I sleep at night
  </>
