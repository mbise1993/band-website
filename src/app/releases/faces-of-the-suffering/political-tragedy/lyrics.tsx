    Producing profit for the privileged few
    <br />
    Tributing my flesh for productivity
    <br />
    Resistance met with iron clad smashing
    <br />
    Through my internal organs
    <br />
    Enforcers of the law
    <br />
    Protect and serve property
    <br />
    <br />
    Poor and huddled masses of refugees
    <br />
    Seeking salvation in the land of the free
    <br />
    Beaten down by hands that don&apos;t feed
    <br />
    Sacrificed to a trickle down economy
    <br />
    <br />
    Decomposing day by day
    <br />
    Decaying day after day
    <br />
    Sinking deeper and deeper
    <br />
    Drowning in the American dream
    <br />
    <br />
    Dignity discarded with yesterday&apos;s garbage
    <br />
    Grinded meat in the murder machine
    <br />
    Taking advantage of marginalized communities
    <br />
    Exclude them from society
    <br />
    <br />
    Institutionalize the helpless
    <br />
    Slaughtered like sheep
    <br />
    Devils profit on unanswered prayers
    <br />
    Martyrs bleed out on capital steps while traitors walk free
