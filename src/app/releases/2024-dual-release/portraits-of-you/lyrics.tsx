    Clutching this wooden box
    <br />
    That keeps my fondest memories
    <br />
    From my exhausted soul
    <br />
    <br />
    Pictures curled into ash
    <br />
    As I burned it all away
    <br />
    Confiding in how much I despise
    <br />
    The separation between us
    <br />
    Confiding in how much
    <br />
    I despise what we've become
    <br />
    <br />
    The holes in the walls tell a somber tale
    <br />
    Of loneliness
    <br />
    Coping with the pain the only way
    <br />
    That I know how
    <br />
    <br />
    Will I find home when I leave this Earth Will I find home when I leave this
    Earth
    <br />
    <br />
    I wish that I had died on that dead end street
    <br />
    So I could haunt this house forever
    <br />
    <br />
    No escaping the fear
    <br />
    Trembling under portraits of you
    <br />
    No running from our mistakes
    <br />
    Shivering in the cold winds of change
    <br />
    <br />
    The heavens will know my name
    <br />
    And the skies will hear my cries
    <br />
    And I promise that I tried my hardest
    <br />
    But I can't help it anymore
    <br />
    I can't heal this hole in my heart
    <br />
    <br />
    You don't have to lie
    <br />
    This is all that I can do
    <br />
    Don't forgive me
    <br />
    I am a burden onto you
    <br />
    <br />
    When the skies burn
    <br />
    I will be here waiting
    <br />
    Confined to my hole in the earth
    <br />
    This is what I deserve
    <br />
    I'm so sorry
    <br />
    I have nothing to live for
    <br />I have nothing to lose
  </>
