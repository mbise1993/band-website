    Falling apart in your hands
    <br />
    Are you busy?
    <br />
    I'm sorry I missed your call
    <br />
    I just wanted to check on you
    <br />
    I heard what happened that night
    <br />
    Feeling safe in your skin
    <br />
    Eraser of all anxiety
    <br />
    <br />
    Freedom from my mind
    <br />
    With you we'll be just fine
    <br />
    <br />
    Etched into tattered walls
    <br />
    Fractured hearts and sunken eyes
    <br />
    It's so cold
    <br />
    It's so cold out here alone
    <br />
    Fractured hearts and sunken eyes
    <br />
    With you we'll be just fine
    <br />
    <br />
    Today was heavy
    <br />
    I thought maybe you'd like to know
    <br />
    Tomorrow will be the same
    <br />
    The days will come and go
    <br />
    Another life, a different perspective
    <br />
    Broken promises we won't let go
    <br />
    <br />
    I will hold onto your pain forever
    <br />
    Call me when you get home safe
    <br />
    I hope get some rest
    <br />
    <br />
    Just try to sleep it off
    <br />
    I only wish you the best
    <br />
    It would mean a lot to me
    <br />
    If you would call me when you get home
    <br />
    <br />
    I miss you, why did you have to go
    <br />
    I miss you, why did you have to go
    <br />
    I miss you, why did you have to go
    <br />
    I miss you, why did you have to go
    <br />
    Be safe
    <br />
    Be safe
  </>
