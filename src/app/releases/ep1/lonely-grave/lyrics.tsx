    Take another pull of cheap whiskey and try to forget
    <br />
    Salvation lies at the bottom of this bottle in my hands
    <br />
    Drinking until I vomit on blood-stained porcelain
    <br />
    The room is spinning and I can’t see straight
    <br />
    <br />
    Blue pills are chains to suspended memories
    <br />
    Forsaken promises and drug abuse tragedies
    <br />
    Faces of the suffering
    <br />
    Begging for you to come home
    <br />
    <br />
    [Spoken]
    <br />
    Searching for solace in a pharmaceutical-induced euphoria
    <br />
    <br />
    Searching for solace in a pharmaceutical-induced euphoria
    <br />
    Sleep forever in a castle made of Xanax
    <br />
    Float in the clouds of my chemical dependency
    <br />
    <br />
    Wake up and find that this life is worse than I could’ve imagined
    <br />
    Worse than the horrors that haunt my dreams
    <br />
    Wake up and find that this life is worse than I could have ever imagined
    <br />
    <br />
    [Spoken]
    <br />
    Only disbelief and distrust for those that I claim to love
    <br />
    Only hatred and pessimism for everyone that I hold dear
    <br />
    <br />
    No grasp of happiness, finding comfort in that it gets worse
    <br />
    Suspicious of anyone who comes close me
    <br />
    Insecurities eat away at what remains of my heart
    <br />
    Never forgive, never forget
    <br />
    <br />
    Avoiding my friends with less effort everyday
    <br />
    Reaching out of a waste of my time and they don’t really care anyway
    <br />
    I will carry these grudges to a lonely grave
    <br />
    I will carry these grudges to a lonely grave
    <br />
    How on earth could you possibly understand
    <br />
    What it’s like to lose everything
    <br />
    <br />
    Desperate, hopeless struggle followed by a miserable death
    <br />
    Desperate, hopeless struggle followed by a miserable death
    <br />
    <br />
    Push everyone away
    <br />
    Bottle up my pain deep inside
    <br />
    Push everyone away
    <br />
    Trust no one die alone
