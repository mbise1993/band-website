        I can't believe what I've seen
        So scratch my eyes out
        You were at ease on your knees in his apartment
        You said his name as I came in your direction
        Now I can choose what to do with both of you
        I loved you, you hurt me
        I loved you, you hurt me bad, go
        Your words, bury me of what I used to be
        I can't erase all those things I've seen
        Your heart smothers me and now it's hard to breathe
        I can't erase all my memories
        I take a step to the left, now you see me
        Tears start to fall as you crawl in his apartment
        You screamed his name as I came in your direction
        Fists start to fly say goodbye there's no excuses
        I loved you, you hurt me
        I loved you, you hurt me bad, go
        Your words, bury me of what I used to be
        I can't erase all those things I've seen
        Your heart smothers me
        And now it's hard to breathe
        I can't erase all my memories
        Hey, there's no excuses
        Hey, there's no excuses
        I loved you, you hurt me
        I loved you, you hurt me bad, go
        Your words, bury me of what I used to be
        I can't erase all those things I've seen
        Your heart smothers me
        And now it's hard to breathe
        I can't erase all my memories
        (erase all my memories of you)
