    I can't believe what I've seen
    <br />
    So scratch my eyes out
    <br />
    You were at ease on your knees in his apartment
    <br />
    You said his name as I came in your direction
    <br />
    Now I can choose what to do with both of you
    <br />
    I loved you, you hurt me I loved you, you hurt me bad, go
    <br />
    Your words, bury me of what I used to be
    <br />
    I can't erase all those things I've seen
    <br />
    Your heart smothers me and now it's hard to breathe
    <br />I can't erase all my memories
